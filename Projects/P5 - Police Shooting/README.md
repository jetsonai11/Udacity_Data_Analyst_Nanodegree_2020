## Project Findings:

### Main findings from the exploration:
> - The vast majority of the victims are males.
> - Caucasians seem to have the highest number of deaths due to police shootings, while blacks are 3 times as likely as whites to become victims of police shootings.
> - Most of the victims did not have signs of mental illness, however, there is still a considerable amount of victims who had signs of mental illness that were shot. 
> - Most of the victims attack the police before they were shot.
> - Most of the victims were not fleeing before they got shot, I supposed this is because they were fighting the police.
> - Very few body camera footages were recorded.
> - The 3 most dangerous states are California, Texas and Florida
> - The 3 most popular weapons of choice is gun, knife and unarmed.
> - The median age for female victims who attacked the police is much older than other victims.
> - The distribution of age of the victims overall is skewed, with most of the victims being in their 20s to late 30s.
> - It appears that there is actually a decreasing trend for police shootings. 
> - For victims who were unarmed, there was a larger proportion with threat level other than attack across all races besides Asians, while very few body footages were recorded.
> - The youngest victim was only 6 years old while the oldest victim was 91 years old.

### Choice of results: 
I did not include all the findings in my report. Instead, I chose to create a compelling story that focuses on the racial bias and the victims who were unarmed.
